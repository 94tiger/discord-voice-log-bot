## Requirements
This bot requires Python 3.5.

To install requirements:

## Configuration
You might want to create a new bot on Discord (i.e., create an application at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/ and turn it into a bot).

Configure the bot by renaming `src/config.example.py` to `src/config.py`, and edit the config.

## Running
Run the bot by executing:
